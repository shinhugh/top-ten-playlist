- Clear session cookie when user deletes self (perhaps unnecessary, since next request with invalid session cookie will
  receive response that clears cookie)

- Potential state corruption due to concurrency

- Periodically purge expired sessions by calling deleteByLessThanOrEqualToExpiration()

- Repositories' delete methods should not throw NoSuchElementException when element does not exist (DONE)
  Service should check for existence and directly throw NoSuchElementException itself (DONE)

- Repository should validate input (non-null or unique) and throw IllegalArgumentException or
  ElementAlreadyExistsException if necessary (DONE)
  Service should not validate input, unless exception throw order is a concern or fields need to be accessed (DONE)

- Test every repository method to verify that the expected exceptions are thrown by the underlying JPA instances (DONE)

- Underlying JPA implementation is inconsistent with how it handles null arguments amongst different methods
  Wrapper repository class should take responsibility for verifying for non-null arguments (IllegalArgumentException)
  (DONE)
