- Clear session cookie when user deletes self (perhaps unnecessary, since next request with invalid session cookie will
  receive response that clears cookie)

- Potential state corruption due to concurrency

- Periodically purge expired sessions by calling deleteByLessThanOrEqualToExpiration()

- Handle native browser navigation (back button, rewriting URLs, navigating to specific pages, etc.)

- Restrict allowed characters for API endpoint inputs

- Explicitly configure case-sensitivity for SQL depending on table and column
  All UUID columns should be case sensitive
  UserAccount Name (LoginName) should be case sensitive for login but case insensitive for creation (duplicate check)
  UserProfile Name (PublicName) should be case insensitive
