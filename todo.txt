- Change type of Session.expiration from Date to something more modern
- Is it okay for copy constructor to shallow copy (UUID, Date, etc)
- Remove redundant code that comes from forgetting that things are references
- Spring should allow through requests without session cookies such that controllers can handle (e.g. 403 instead of 400)
